# RedHook
RedHook is a Python-based phishing detection suite with a modern PyQt5 dark theme. It fetches and analyzes Gmail messages, scans embedded URLs using a hybrid machine learning + heuristic approach, integrates with VirusTotal for real-time threat checks, and stores results in a local SQLite database for easy review.
